Description
The system is built with Laravel, an open source PHP framework. The system uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern to divide the application into three layers:

Model: This layer handles the business logic and data access.
View: This layer handles the presentation of data to the user.
Controller: This layer handles user requests and sends them to the model and view layers.
The system uses the MySQL database to store data.
